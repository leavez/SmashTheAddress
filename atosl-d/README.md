# atosl

__atosl__ is a partial replacement for Apple's atos tool for converting
addresses within a binary file to symbols.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/atosl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/atosl)

## Why

The primary benefit of atosl is its ability to run on other platforms.
atosl has been tested on Linux but will likely run on any platform that
libdwarf is available for.

## Requirements

[libdwarf](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libdwarf/) - This library
does the heavily lifting of parsing the DWARF debugging data within the
binaries.

### Install Dependencies on OS X

#### Install Homebrew

```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
```

#### Install Dependencies

```sh
brew install binutils
brew install https://gist.github.com/zlandau/7550479/raw/f72753f6a59f6a3fadf9a2e2952a9f6846c15a8d/libdwarf.rb
```

#### Update config.mk.local

```sh
echo "LDFLAGS += -L$(dirname $(brew list binutils| grep libiberty.a))" >> config.mk.local
```

## Usage

atosl currently supports debug (DSYM) files and DYLIB with debug symbols

```
$ atosl -o SomeApp.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/SomeApp --load-address 0x3c00 0x12345 0x55555
-[AwesomenessContainer parseAwesomeness:error:] (in SomeApp) (AwesomenessContainer.m:400)
-[LamenessEliminator destroyLameness] (in SomeApp) (LamenessEliminator.m:204)
```

Note that there are two methods of symbol lookup. The default method
looks through the DWARF complication units. If you use the --globals
option it instead reads from the .debug_pubnames section. You should try
both options to see which one you find most reliable and fastest.

## Limitations and differences

* Doesn't display function parameters in the symbols
  * This could be added, it just wasn't deemed worth the cycles
* Only supports ARM

## Future Work

* Speed improvements
  * Some of the libdwarf routines are implemented without too much concern for
    performance.
* Add support for more architectures
  * There's nothing particularly architecture-specific other than having to map
    between an architecture name and its identifier so we can find them in the
    Mach binary
* Caching, caching, caching
* Reduce cases were atosl output differs from atos (for whatever reason)
* Port to a version of libdwarf that is still supported
